                        A good Retail POS system should offer customisable settings, so you can tailor it to your business needs. For example, you might need to set up automatic discounts, loyalty programs, and special promotions or change tax settings.

                            A retail POS system, or point-of-sale system, is a software and hardware solution that helps retailers process transactions at the point of sale, record sales and manage inventory. The hardware components are usually a cash register, barcode scanner, android tablet and card reader, and software that allows you to manage everything.

                            Simply put, a retail POS system can help retailers save time, money, and sanity. With a POS system, retailers can ring up sales faster than a cheetah on espresso, and track inventory levels more accurately than a bloodhound on a scent. And let's not forget the improved efficiency, streamlined operations, and overall business insights that a POS system can provide over a humane counterpart. So, whether you're a small business owner or a retail giant, a POS is a must-have tool for success.

                            Absolutely. Most POS systems currently available in the Australian market don’t have employee management features but POSApt wouldn’t let you down. We have added employee management features, such as time and attendance tracking, shift scheduling, and performance monitoring just for you.
