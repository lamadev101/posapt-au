                            Normally, the setup time is around 1 - 2 hours. Given that you already have the hardware system ready. If not, the time will be consumed to purchase dedicated hardware based on your need. However, cloud-based systems such as POSApt can be set up quickly as compared to on-premise systems.

                            The time it takes to set up a POS System for your hospitality business varies on a number of factors such as the system provider, the complexity of the system and the number of locations you want to set it up, for instance; in a franchised business. Cloud-based systems such as POSApt can be set up quickly, while on-premises systems may take longer to install and configure.
