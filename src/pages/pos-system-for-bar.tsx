                        What good is a system that’s clunky, can’t be customised to your needs and too complicated for your staff to understand? So, this system should be super easy to navigate, with intuitive menu management features that let you add, edit, and remove items with ease.

                            A bar POS system is a hardware and software solution designed specifically for use in bars and nightclubs at the point of transaction. It generally tracks orders, calculates prices, processes payments, and records all transactions. Many POS systems today are smarter with features such as inventory management, employee scheduling and performance tracking, and customer data analysis.

                            The cost of a bar point-of-sale system varies depending on a number of factors including the provider, its features, and the hardware components included. Generally, popular POS systems in Australia charge anywhere from $70 - $300 a month but POSApt has a starting price of ${price.basic}/month for the basic setup.

                            It generally takes anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to completely set up a Bar POS system. However, it depends on a number of factors such as the system provider, the complexity of the system and the number of locations you want to set it up, for instance; in a franchised business. Cloud-based systems such as POSApt can be set up quickly, while on-premises systems may take longer to install and configure.

                            Yes, many POS systems that are designed for Bars and Lounges include features such as ID scanning and age verification to help ensure compliance with alcohol sales regulations.
