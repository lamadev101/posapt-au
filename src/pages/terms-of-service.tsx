                This page outlines the terms and conditions applicable to your use
                of any of our services. By using our services, you agree to these
                terms in addition to any service-specific terms that may also
                apply (like Online Ordering, for example). If you use our services
                on behalf of your business, your business acknowledges them as
                well.
              </p>
              <p>
                These General Terms of Service ("General Terms") govern your use
                of POSApt's services, including mobile applications, websites,
                software, cloud-based solutions, hardware, and other products and
                services (collectively, the "Services"). By using any of the
                Services, you agree to these General Terms and any policies
                referenced within ("Terms"), which are collectively incorporated
                herein by reference, including our Privacy Statement (see Section
                8) and terms that limit our liability (see Section 19) and require
                individual arbitration for any potential legal dispute (see
                Section 22). You also agree to any other conditions relevant to
                the Services you use ("Additional Terms"), such as those mentioned
                below, which are included in your agreement with us (collectively,
                the "Terms"). If you are using the Services on behalf of a
                business, you represent to us that you have the power to bind that
                business to these Terms and that the business accepts these Terms.
                We request you carefully review all of our Terms.
